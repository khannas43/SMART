Documents created
1. AI_ML_USE_CASE_CAPABILITY_MATRIX.md
Capability matrix for all 11 AI/ML use cases
REST API documentation with examples
Data output formats
Integration patterns
Portal screen mapping suggestions
Ready to share with the Citizen Portal Agent
2. CITIZEN_PORTAL_SCREEN_MAPPING_TEMPLATE.md
Template for mapping 20 screens to use cases
Sections: Screen details, use cases, API integration, data flow, UI components, user actions
Summary matrix template
Integration priority categorization
Ready for the Portal Agent to fill out
3. CITIZEN_PORTAL_INTEGRATION_ROADMAP.md
Roadmap tracker
Phases: Mapping → Planning → Implementation → Testing
Innovation opportunities section (to be filled after review)

Recommended workflow
Step 1: Share with Portal Agent
Share these files:
AI_ML_USE_CASE_CAPABILITY_MATRIX.md — reference document
CITIZEN_PORTAL_SCREEN_MAPPING_TEMPLATE.md — template to fill
All 20 screen SRS documents
Step 2: Portal Agent creates mapping
The Portal Agent should:
Review the capability matrix
Map each of the 20 screens to relevant AI/ML use cases
Fill out the mapping template
Identify API integration points
Document data flows
Step 3: AI/ML team review
After receiving the mapping document, I will:
Review all 20 screen mappings
Suggest innovative/advanced features
Identify optimization opportunities
Recommend additional AI/ML capabilities
Create a detailed integration plan

What to ask the Portal Agent
"Please review the AI_ML_USE_CASE_CAPABILITY_MATRIX.md document and map all 20 Citizen Portal screens to the relevant AI/ML use cases. Use the CITIZEN_PORTAL_SCREEN_MAPPING_TEMPLATE.md template to document:
Which screens use which AI/ML use cases
What APIs need to be called
How data flows through each screen
What UI components will display AI/ML data
What user actions trigger AI/ML operations

Once complete, I'll review the mapping and suggest innovative features and enhancements."
Expected outcomes
After the Portal Agent completes the mapping, I can provide:
Feature suggestions — AI/ML enhancements per screen
Optimization recommendations — performance and UX improvements
Integration patterns — reusable components and flows
Advanced capabilities — ML-driven features not yet implemented
Prioritization — which integrations to do first
All documents are saved and ready. Share them with the Portal Agent to proceed.
