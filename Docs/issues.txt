Resolved
Profile
1. In profile tree view, change the family member name so that it should reflect properly in tree view
2. Entire Profile dashboard (http://localhost:3000/citizen/profile/dashboard) for both tabs and family member profile (http://localhost:3000/citizen/profile/family/f6a3f5f2-4b2e-4ce3-931b-1f28bb169f2c) is coming in English irrespective of Hindi language selected
9. Error "Failed to update Consent preference" when updating data sharing consent for "Address", "Email" etc. for all components
1. at top right corner, U is coming which looks like is user. this should changed to user name abbreviations of first + last name like for Rani Thakur, this should be RT. RT should be available both in English and Hindi

2. For Profile menu, submenus can be removed and let top level menu of Profile be linked to Profile Dashboard (http://localhost:3000/citizen/profile/dashboard)
3. on Profile Dashboard (http://localhost:3000/citizen/profile/dashboard), quick actions can be removed

5. On profile Dashboard, only scheme enrolled should be shown to used, what is the point in showing all schemes
6.For family snapshot, name of family member to be shown
4. when profile dashboard is loaded, message pop up - Server Error. please try again
7. Bring data sharing consent from 36o degree view page to summary page
8. we don't need to provide hyperlink to seed name as their details are already available in Profile dashboard, which is the starting point for any tree or relationship


Scheme
1. All scheme are still showing in English even when portal is in Hindi mode. So all scheme snapshot should be available in Hindi
2. scheme details page (http://localhost:3000/citizen/schemes/1b909003-204b-463b-a7f3-933bba0fd0a2)- everything need to be shown in Hindi
4. For eligibly checker, for logged in user, data should be filled automatically, as this data is already available with us. whatever data we have, let's populate that and rest can be filled by user. User can also edit populated data
3. Eligibility criteria-- should be shown in plain English not in some code format, the way its coming now
{
  "max_age": null,
  "min_age": null,
  "min_marks": null,
  "income_max": 100000,
  "benefit_type": "Financial Aid",
  "bpl_required": true,
  "target_caste": null,
  "benefit_amount": 24000,
